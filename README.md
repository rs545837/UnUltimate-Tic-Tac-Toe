# UnUltimate-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is an implementation of Tic Tac Toe that is not so ultimate, that's not even a general tic tac toe, but a totally new version which got generated out of a bug. 
This repository basically contains the verilog files of the project and the xdc file for constraints which are specifically used with a Basys 3 Board.
You will need Xiling ISE Design suite to program the board and run the project.

### Materials Used
